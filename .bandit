# Bandit security configuration for ModelMuxer
# This configuration excludes legitimate usage patterns that have been security reviewed

# Tests to skip - these are acceptable patterns in our codebase:
skips: ['B101', 'B104', 'B110', 'B301', 'B311', 'B403']

# B101: assert_used - Asserts used for runtime validation of optional dependencies
# B104: hardcoded_bind_all_interfaces - 0.0.0.0 binding is intentional for containerized deployment
# B110: try_except_pass - Silent exception handling is intentional for graceful degradation
# B301: pickle usage - Legacy cache format compatibility, controlled environment
# B311: random usage - Non-cryptographic jitter for retry backoff
# B403: pickle import - Legacy cache format compatibility, controlled environment

# Exclude test directories from security scanning
exclude_dirs: ['tests', 'test', '__pycache__']
